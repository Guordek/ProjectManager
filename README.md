# Project Manager

This app allows you to create projects and add some tasks inside.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Web server (Apache)
SQL server (MySQL)
PHP
Composer
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
- Clone the repository
- Create a new database
- Copy the ".env.example" file and rename it to ".env"
- Enter your configuration
- Open a terminal in the folder
> composer update
> php artisan migrate:fresh --seed
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
